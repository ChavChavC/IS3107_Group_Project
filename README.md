# IS3107 Group Project

This repository contains the code and data for the IS3107 group project. Here's a brief overview of the directory structure:

1. **airflow**: This directory contains most of our work, including data transformation and pipeline code implemented using Apache Airflow. The data used for the pipeline is also stored here.

2. **data**: Initially, we stored the data scraped during testing in this directory.

3. **scrapers**: This directory contains the code we wrote for manual testing of our scraping process. Additionally, our Agoda scraping code is located here.

4. **app**: In this directory, we utilized the downstream data for our application.

5. **Other Files**: The remaining CSV files and Google Place code were created as part of our experimentation in building the data pipeline.

Feel free to explore each directory for more details on the code and data used in our project.
